# Registration of segmentation of external layers

To analyze the results from segmentation layers of your images within the context of the atlas-aligned image, allow you to import external layers that will be analyzed by brainreg-segment.

This layer will be then segmented as a 3D \(or 2D\) structure, such as area covering all your bulk axonal projections of interes analyzed by a binary mask.  

:::{hint}
You can record the coordinates of segmentations performed with other napari plugins or masks generated in different programs, which can be saved as TIFF files. This allows you to "import" these results into brainreg-segment and analyze them within the atlas context. In order to align your segmented structures with the atlas, it is necessary to run your segmentation plugin on the _downsample channel of interest that is generated by brainreg. 
:::

Select the `Region Segmentation` button in the `Segmentation panel`.

To load your data

* Load project (sample space) - This is for loading a brainreg project in the coordinate space of your raw data (i.e not warped to the atlas space). 
* Load project (atlas space) - This is for loading a brainreg project in the atlas space. Use this space if later you will like to use this layers also to import and to plot in brainrender.
:::{caution}
Ensure that the external layer you wish to include for analysis is generated in the same space as the project you are loading. Otherwise, it will not be possible to incorporate it for analysis.

Additional installations to your enviroment are needed

Requirements:
* You can utilize other segmentation plugins to generate an external layer according to your convenience. These plugins enable you to generate threshold or binary files in your desired image. For example, you can use the plugin available at https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing.git. To install this plugin, you have two options: either install it within the Conda environment or use the plugin install window in napari.
* To enhance your functionality, you may consider installing additional plugins for napari. These plugins can be found at napari-simpleitk-image-processing. Alternatively, you can use the napari assistant, which provides a graphical user interface for plugin installation. You can access different segmentation options by navigating to the Plugins or Tools menu. For more information on segmentation options developed in napari specifically for fluorescence microscopy, you can refer to https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes

Then: 
* To open a .tiff file in Napari for thresholding or masking purposes, follow these steps:
Launch Napari.
Go to the "File" menu and select "Open".
Navigate to the location of the .tiff file you want to work with.
Select the file and click "Open".
The .tiff file will now be opened as a layer in Napari, ready for thresholding or masking operations.
* To perform segmentation, you have the option of using the simpleitk plugin or other napari plugins that utilize deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Here's how you can use the napari-simpleitk-image-processing plugin to apply a threshold, such as Otsu's threshold, to the opened TIFF image and save the result:
Access the plugins in Napari.
Look for the napari-simpleitk-image-processing plugin and select it.
Within the plugin, choose the desired thresholding method, such as Otsu's threshold.
Select the opened TIFF image as the input for the plugin.
Run the plugin to generate the thresholded image.
Once the thresholded image is generated, you can save it by going to the File menu in Napari and selecting "Save As" or by using the appropriate saving option provided by the plugin.

You can have an overview of some examples here 
* Use https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant
* Use https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops
:::{note}

Then:
* Open the brainreg-segment plugin
* Open the region segmentation panel
* Open the registration folder output from brainreg in either the sample or atlas space. Ensure that you use the same space that was used for generating the external thresholded image.
* Open the thresholded image and maintain your cursor on that layer.
* Click the `Add region from existing layer` button
* If required, rename this region 


* Add a new region if required 
* Repeat above for each region you wish to segment.
* Click `Analyse regions` to analyse the spatial distribution of the regions you have drawn (as done for the 3D structures segmentation).
  * If `Calculate volumes` is selected, the volume of each brain area included in the segmented region will be calculated and saved.
  * If `Summarise volumes` is selected, then each region will be summarised \(centers, volumes etc\)

  * If `to brainrender` is selected, then each region will generate the obj file that you can use later for rendering. See [Analyze and visualize tracing experiments](/tutorials/tracing-tracking) for more details on the rendering options.
